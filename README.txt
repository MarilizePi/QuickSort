Brief description of submitted files:

src/QuickSort/FHsort.java
    - Provided by the course, which contains sorting methods to sort arrays of different sizes.

src/QuickSort/TestRecursion.java
    - This class tests quick sort algorithm of various array sizes (total of 20 intervals between 20,000 and 10,000,000)
    with a range between 2 and 300 recursions, increased by two, as well as getting the amount of time it takes
    for each array to run. Also getting the average of three runs to filter out any non-significant differences in the run time.
    - Contains main.

src/QuickSort/TimeConverter.java
    - Converts duration into a string representation.
